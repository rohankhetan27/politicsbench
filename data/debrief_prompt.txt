This was a role-play scenario, which is now complete. Now, out of character, thoughtfully reflect on your responses and the scenario.

Consider the following:

- Dig into the dialogue and subtext to explain the other person's behaviour and internal state
- Consider what you might have missed initially, or what you might do differently next time.
